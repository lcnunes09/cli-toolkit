# 📀 CLI Toolkit
A lightweight and expressive CLI toolkit for Git cleanup, repo hygiene, and everyday automation. Designed to save your time — and your branches.

## 🛠 Installation (Recommended: Setup Script)

Clone the repo and run the setup script:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:lcnunes09/cli-toolkit.git && cd cli-toolkit && ./scripts/setup.sh
```

This will:

- ✅ Make all CLI tools in bin/ executable
- ✅ Add the CLI directory to your shell path (.zshrc or .bashrc)
- ✅ Warn you if Git or SSH are missing or misconfigured
- ✅ Add an alias ghcli to jump to the repo folder
- ✅ Remind you to source your shell to finish setup

# ✅ Usage Cheatsheet

## 🩹 ghclean – Clean merged Git branches

Deletes all merged local and remote branches in one go — except protected ones like main, dev, and master.

```bash
ghclean --help
ghclean --dry-run             # Preview deletions
ghclean --remote-only         # Only delete remote branches
ghclean --confirm             # Prompt before each deletion
ghclean --dry-run --confirm   # Preview and prompt
```
- ✅ Safe: must run from a base branch (main, dev, master)
- ✅ Smart: skips protected branches and shows a cleanup summary
- ✅ Powerful: cleans all merged branches in one pass

## 🌿 ghprune – Remove stale local branches

Deletes local branches that were removed remotely (e.g. after a PR is merged):

```bash
ghprune                  # See which local branches were actually removed
```

## 💾 ghsafe – Backup your repo

Creates a .bundle archive of your repo — all branches included:

```bash
ghsafe
```

Perfect for backups or safe transfer.

## 📊 ghstatus – Repo summary at a glance

Displays Git info like:
- Current branch
- Uncommitted changes
- Unpushed commits
- Remote tracking
- Unmerged branches (into base)

```bash
ghstatus                 # Quick status
ghstatus --verbose       # Full details
ghstatus --base main     # Check what's not merged into 'main'
ghstatus -v --base dev   # Verbose for unmerged into dev
```

## 🧑‍💻 ghwhoami – See your Git identity

Displays your configured Git name, email, SSH connection status, and whether an SSH key is present.


```bash
ghwhoami
```

## 🤖 Coming Soon Ideas

- `ghtrack` – Fix or report branches not tracking origin
- `ghdiff` – Show diff vs main with flags
- `ghreset` – Hard reset local branch to remote
- `ghfix` – Common Git misconfig fixes
